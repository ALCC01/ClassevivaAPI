============
How it works
============

In a nutshell, the library makes requests to the original website, parses the HTML code and returns data in JSON format, that can be implemented in pretty much every application.

===============
Getting Started
===============

As a module
-----------

First, you'll need to install the module:

.. code-block:: none

    npm i --save classeviva

Once the package is installed, you can star working with the library.

.. code-block:: javascript

    const classeviva = require('classeviva');

    classeviva.login({
        usercode: 'G0000000A',
        password: 'plsdontsaveinplaintext'
    }).then(session => {
        session.grades().then(grades => {
            console.log(grades)
        })
    })

As a REST API
-------------

First, clone the project repository (or access the library folder inside the ``node_modules``):

.. code-block:: none

    git clone git@github.com:ALCC01/ClassevivaAPI.git

Then copy the ``config.dist.json`` file to ``config.json`` and start the server:

.. code-block:: none

    npm start
